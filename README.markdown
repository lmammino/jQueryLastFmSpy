jQueryLastFmSpy
===============

jQueryLastFmSpy or simply LastFmSpy is a simple event driven javascript library that relies on [last.fm](http://www.last.fm) API to allow you to literally "spy" what your friends are listening to.
The library is still heavily incomplete, scarcely tested and undocumented, so keep watching this repo if you're interested in the whole idea and keep considering contributions: suggestions, criticisms, pull requests are always appreciated.


I hope updates will come soon!
